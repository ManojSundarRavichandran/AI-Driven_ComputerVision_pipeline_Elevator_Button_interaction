# AI-Driven_ComputerVision_pipeline_Elevator_Button_interaction
This repository contains the code and resources for the 'Elevator Bot Arm Control' project. The goal of this project is to develop a system that allows a robotic arm to interact with an elevator by pressing buttons using a finetune model Yolov5 to detect the buttons.
